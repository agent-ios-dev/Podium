/// Address translation, once the
/// guest sets SCTLR.M, *is* real — see `ARMv7MMU` — walking the guest's
/// own translation tables for every instruction fetch and data access
/// rather than leaving memory untranslated; CP15 registers other than
/// the ones that walk directly reads (like SCTLR, TTBR0/1, TTBCR, DACR)
/// are still just a stored value — see `CP15State` — not acted on (cache
/// maintenance, TLB invalidation, etc). Several ARM-state instruction
/// families are also unimplemented: multiply, SPSR access, most of the
/// coprocessor and unconditional-instruction spaces, SWI (see
/// `ARMDecoder`'s doc comment for the exact list); Thumb has its own,
/// separate coverage gaps (see `ThumbDecoder`'s doc comment). Hitting
/// any of those sets `lastError`
/// and halts rather than skipping the instruction or guessing at its
/// effect — silently pressing on past something this CPU doesn't
